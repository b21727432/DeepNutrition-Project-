Our term project of BBM406 Fundamentals of Machine Learning Lecture in Hacettepe University Computer Science.
We tested RESNet-50, VGGNet-16, Inceptionv3 (aka GoogleNet). Results have demonstrated at paper.
We have over %85 prediction accuracy for food recognition from 101 food class.
We worked on Food-101 Dataset.

# Food recognition from image for facilitating the dietary assessment process.

Dietary assessment plays a signiﬁcant role in ﬁghting obesity. In this paper, we used computer vision techniques to facilitate the dietary assessment process by detecting foods from images. We used the Food-101 dataset which consists of 101 classes and developed a model that uses a ﬁne-tuned model of InceptionV3 and get 85% top-1 accuracy. In this process, we tried different Models, Activation Functions, LossFunctions, Dropouts, LearningRates, Batch Sizes. We observed the model’s behavior in each of those conditions and tried to get the best case possible. Our results show that the InceptionV3 which is a CNN model can be a good choice for identifying Foods by using Food-101 Dataset.
